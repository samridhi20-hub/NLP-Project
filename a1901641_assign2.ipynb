Hence, I lemmatized the article chosen by the user, and removed all kinds of punctuation except full-stops.

    "## D. Coreference Resolution Utility\n",
    "\n",
    "The model takes the article, and pre-processes the context. It is then split into sentences. Coreference resolution involves identifying all instances in a text where different expressions refer to the same entity. This task is essential for various advanced NLP applications like document summarization, question answering, and information extraction, as it enhances natural language understanding by resolving ambiguous references (The Stanford NLP Group n.d.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Coreference occurs when a subsequent mention in a text refers back to an entity or event introduced earlier. In essence, two expressions are said to corefer when they denote the same entity or event. In a coreference resolution system, the process involves identifying mentions of entities and subsequently grouping mentions that refer to the same entity. Each mention is represented by a continuous sequence of words. These systems learn from annotated data where mentions are grouped into entity clusters, and their performance is evaluated by comparing the system's grouping of mentions to the predefined clusters in the test dataset (Explosion.ai 2022). Coreference resolution serves as a highly adaptable tool applicable across a spectrum of NLP tasks, including text understanding, information extraction, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and document summarization (NeuroSys n.d.).

not  likeworking  girl  .john  pearson  model  .my  agent  called  up  and  saidhey  do  you  want  to  do  this  videoall  the  big  girl  are  doing  it.of  course  i  said  yes  .i  wa  a  big  george  michael  fan  .i  used  to  see  him  all  the  time  in  london  at  the  club  .i  arrived  at  the  studio  at  3  o  clock  in  the  afternoon  and  met  david  fincher  briefly  and  then  basically  sat  around  all  day  and  watched  while  christy  and  linda  were  being  shot  .there  s  one  shot  where  linda  put  her  head  underneath  her  sweater  that  s  amazing  .that  wasn  t  rehearsed  .linda  really  know  how  to  use  her  body  to  communicate  in  an  elegant  way  never  cheap  and  tawdry  .george  wa  there  very  warm  and  nice  but  very  shy  .the  day  went  long  and  the  producer  said  at  the  end  of  the  day  can  we  shoot  you  tomorrowi  didn  t  have  another  job  booked  so  i  saidsure  .then  he  saiddo  you  mind  doing  it  for  nothingi  saidno  way  .it  wa  a  little  bit  bolshie  of  me  but  i  knew  what  the  girl  were  getting  .in  the  end  i  wa  paid  15  000  for  the  day  which  is  not  bad  to  hang  out  with  these  fabulous  beautiful  girl  .but  i  d  been  working  nonstop  for  three  year  and  i  wasn  t  going  to  do  it  for  free  .and  it  turned  out  to  be  one  of  those  fabulously  easy  job  everyone  riding  on  this  wave  of  semistardom  and  recognition  for  the  model  .i  really  didn  t  realize  how  big  it  all  wa  at  the  time  .candis  cayne  actress  model  and  former  drag  personality  .there  wa  a  group  of  girl  in  n.  y.  c.  in  the  90  and  we  didn  t  want  to  model  ourselves  on  anything  other  than  the  supermodel  .linda  and  naomi  and  christy  .so  when  the  video  offreedomcame  out  and  they  were  all  in  it  we  were  obsessed  .i  used  to  do  show  at  boy  bar  so  i  decided  i  wa  going  to  dofreedomand  got  lina  and  mistress  formika  and  sherry  vine  to  play  the  various  part  .i  wa  linda  .she  wa  my  favorite  .we  did  the  whole  thing  naked  under  white  sheet  .after  the  very  last  chorus  we  dropped  the  sheet  and  were  completely  naked  holding  our  groin  area  .that  song  meant  a  lot  to  u  .there  were  singer  we  knew  were  gay  then  but  no  one  really  talked  about  it  .we  just  grabbed  onto  song  and  artist  who  knew  who  and  what  we  were  whether  it  wa  madonna  withvogueandtruth  or  dare  or  george  michael  withfreedomi  don  t  know  if  he  wa  openly  gay  or  not  then  .i  guess  not  .but  it  wa  almost  o.  k.  because  we  all  knew  and  it  wa  such  a  homophobic  time  .it  wa  so  oppressive  particularly  when  you  factor  in  the  aid  epidemic  .to  be  open  would  have  been  a  career  killer  .but  going  to  a  club  listening  to  freedomit  wa  an  escape  .alan  hunter  one  of  the  original  mtv  v.  j.  s  .it  wa  a  funny  moment  in  my  life  .i  wa  driving  my  kid  to  day  care  on  a  day  where  i  didn  t  know  where  my  career  had  gone  .i  d  left  mtv  .my  agent  wasn  t  calling  .i  wa  depressed  .and  i  turned  on  the  radio  and  on  came  george  michael  s  new  song  .it  wa  george  michael  at  the  peak  of  his  writing  skill  .it  wa  such  a  brilliant  capstone  i  d  ever  heard  .it  wa  his  song  .he  wa  sayingeverything  that  brought  me  to  pop  stardom  i  now  disavow  .then  i  saw  the  video  shortly  thereafter  with  all  that  iconography  he  d  used  in  his  past  and  he  literally  set  those  thing  on  fire  and  explodes  them  .the  leather  jacket  he  d  worn  and  the  jukebox  fromfaith  .and  he  just  step  away  .he  wasn  t  even  in  the  video  .it  showed  how  serious  he  wa  even  while  he  said  it  all  with  a  lot  of  love  .it  wa  such  a  joyous  song  .i  actually  felt  happy  .zac  posen  fashion  designer  .i  wa  10  year  old  10  or  11  .i  d  see  it  in  my  living  room  waiting  for  madonna  to  come  on  .i  probably  wanted  to  be  the  child  in  open  your  heart  .but  what  i  remember  aboutfreedomwa  that  it  wa  kind  of  a  seminal  predecessor  to  grunge  .because  you  have  these  incredibly  glamorous  beauty  in  a  very  industrial  corinne  day  space  .there  s  water  dripping  down  the  wall  and  george  michael  s  leather  jacket  is  on  fire  and  the  model  are  naked  .it  wa  really  the  glamour

    "The test utility sets up a test scenario for evaluating a question-answering system. It provides a list of 10 questions (test_questions) and corresponding answers (test_answers). Each question is paired with a sentence containing the answer to that question. This setup allows for testing the question-answering system by comparing the answers generated by the system against the provided ground truth answers. By evaluating the system's performance against known correct answers, one can assess its accuracy and effectiveness in answering questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, I defined a function match_question_to_sentence to identify sentences containing answers to user questions based on predefined rules. The rules specify patterns to match against sentences. When a user question is provided, the function searches for matches between the question and sentences using regular expressions and the defined rules. For instance, if the user question is \"What is the song by George Michael?\", the function matches it to the rule \"new song by George Michael\" and identifies the corresponding sentence \"and on came george michael s new song.\" The matching sentences containing answers to the user's question are then printed. If no matches are found, it indicates \"No matching sentences found.\""

    "## H. Calculating MRR\n",
    "\n",
    "MRR is a metric used to evaluate systems that return a ranked list of results. It measures the average of the reciprocal ranks of the first relevant document retrieved for each query. MRR is particularly useful when only the top-ranked result is considered relevant, as is often the case in question-answering tasks (Evidently AI n.d.). I chose MRR over the other metrics (F1 score and MAP) due to its simplicity, alignment with task goals, and focus on the top-ranked result, making it a suitable choice for evaluating the effectiveness of such systems. MRR is a straightforward metric that captures the effectiveness of the system in returning relevant results without considering the entire ranked list. This simplicity makes it easy to understand and interpret."

    "## I. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this project focused on developing and evaluating a question-answering system using natural language processing techniques. The process involved several key steps namely preprocessing the text data, vectorization of text data, evaluation of the question-answering system and testing the system. Overall, the project demonstrated the effectiveness of natural language processing techniques in building question-answering systems and highlighted the importance of choosing appropriate evaluation metrics based on the task requirements. Moving forward, further refinements and optimizations could be explored to enhance the system's performance and usability in real-world applications. The answering to the question can be made more accurate by training the model with a fine-tuned BERT. The systemâ€™s accuracy in extracting the exact, correct answer can be increased by making the pre-processing of the text better. The scope of this project is limited to a single, one-time question-answer. "
